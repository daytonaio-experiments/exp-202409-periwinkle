### AI-Enhanced Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Environment

**Job to be Done:**

**When** everyone in a team, regardless of technical skill, needs to contribute to software development through Behavior Driven Development (BDD),

**We want to** create an AI-enhanced environment that converts natural language descriptions into Gherkin scenarios, generates step definitions, and provides code implementations using a predefined set of tools, such as VS Code and structured markdown files.

**So that** all team members can actively participate in the development process, reducing the complexity of writing test scenarios and code, and ensuring the software meets business requirements.

### Objectives

1. **Natural Language to Gherkin:** Develop an AI tool that converts plain English descriptions into Gherkin syntax and places them in structured markdown files.
2. **Automated Step Definitions:** Generate step definitions and corresponding code implementations using AI and organize them in predefined folder structures.
3. **Context-Aware Suggestions:** Provide context-aware suggestions for improving or extending BDD scenarios and step definitions within markdown files.
4. **Tool Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with VS Code and a predefined set of BDD tools like Cucumber.

### High-Level Functional Specification for AI-Enhanced Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Environment

#### Overview
This document outlines the functional specification for the AI-Enhanced Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Environment, a feature in the Daytona project designed to enable everyone, regardless of technical skill, to contribute to software development through BDD. The system leverages AI to convert natural language descriptions into Gherkin scenarios, generate step definitions and code implementations, and provide context-aware suggestions, all integrated within VS Code and structured markdown files.

#### Functional Requirements

**1. Natural Language to Gherkin**
- **AI-Powered Translation:**
  - Develop an AI model capable of translating plain English descriptions of features into Gherkin syntax, supporting "Given-When-Then" format.
  - Ensure the AI model understands context and maintains the meaning and requirements specified in the plain English descriptions.
- **Structured Markdown Files:**
  - Store the generated Gherkin scenarios in structured markdown files within a predefined folder hierarchy.
  - Ensure the markdown files are organized in a way that is intuitive for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**2. Automated Step Definitions**
- **Step Definition Generation:**
  - Implement AI algorithms to automatically generate step definitions and corresponding code based on Gherkin scenarios.
  - Ensure the generated code is compatible with popular BDD frameworks like Cucumber, Behave, and SpecFlow.
- **Organized Code Structure:**
  - Place the generated step definitions and code implementations in a predefined folder structure within the project repository.
  - Provide clear documentation and naming conventions to ensure the code is easily understandable and maintainable.

**3. Context-Aware Suggestions**
- **Suggestion Engine:**
  - Develop a suggestion engine that provides context-aware recommendations for improving or extending BDD scenarios and step definitions within markdown files.
  - Consider factors such as consistency, completeness, and alignment with best practices when generating suggestions.
- **Inline Suggestions:**
  - Provide inline suggestions within markdown files, ensuring that all team members can easily access and apply the recommendations.

**4. Tool Integration**
- **VS Code Integration:**
  - Develop extensions or plugins for VS Code that facilitate the creation, editing, and management of BDD scenarios and step definitions using markdown files.
  - Provide syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and other productivity features to enhance the BDD workflow in VS Code.
- **Predefined BDD Tools:**
  - Ensure seamless integration with a predefined set of BDD tools such as Cucumber for running and managing tests.
  - Offer configuration templates to simplify the setup and usage of these tools within the project.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:**
  - Design the system to support multiple concurrent users and large projects without performance degradation.
- **Usability:**
  - Ensure the markdown-based workflow is intuitive and user-friendly, catering to both technical and non-technical team members.
- **Reliability:**
  - Ensure high reliability and accuracy in generating Gherkin scenarios, step definitions, and context-aware suggestions.
- **Security:**
  - Maintain the confidentiality and integrity of user data and project information throughout the entire process.

#### Deployment and Integration
- **Integration with Daytona:**
  - Seamlessly integrate the AI-Enhanced BDD Environment with the existing Daytona architecture and workflows.
  - Ensure compatibility with supported configuration file formats and development setups in Daytona.
- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the solution on scalable and secure infrastructure, ensuring it can handle the expected load and provide reliable service to users.
  - Offer deployment options for local environments, as well as remote or cloud-based setups with strict data locality requirements.

#### Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding:**
  - Enhance the AI model to better understand complex business requirements and nuances in natural language descriptions.
- **Multi-Language Support:**
  - Expand support for generating Gherkin and step definitions in multiple natural languages to cater to global teams.
- **Collaborative Features:**
  - Develop collaborative features that enable multiple stakeholders to contribute to and review BDD scenarios and step definitions in real-time.
- **Integration with Project Management Tools:**
  - Explore integration with project management tools like Jira and Trello to streamline the tracking and management of BDD scenarios and test automation efforts.

By implementing the AI-Enhanced Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Environment, Daytona aims to enable every team member, regardless of technical skill, to actively participate in the software development process. This feature will facilitate efficient communication and collaboration through AI-driven BDD practices, ensuring that the software meets business requirements while reducing manual effort and complexity. The structured integration with VS Code and markdown files will provide a familiar and accessible workflow for all users.
